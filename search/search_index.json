Each block includes a cryptographic hash of the preceding block, a timestamp, and transaction data. The structure of blockchain ensures that once data is recorded, it is nearly impossible to alter, providing a high level of security. One of the key advantages of blockchain is its decentralized nature, eliminating the need for middlemen, which reduces both time and potential conflicts. Despite its challenges, blockchain technology is recognized for being faster, more economical, and more secure compared to traditional systems, which is why it\u2019s being increasingly adopted by banks and governments.</p> <p>Now, imagine a contract that automatically executes when certain conditions are met, with the entire process managed by the blockchain network.

Once these predefined rules are satisfied, the contract automatically enforces the terms. Smart contracts facilitate, verify, and enforce the execution of an agreement or transaction without needing an intermediary, representing the simplest form of decentralized automation.</p> <p>Put simply, a smart contract allows for the exchange of assets\u2014whether money, property, or anything else\u2014without the involvement of a middleman. This leads to trustless execution, where the contract enforces the terms without relying on any party\u2019s honesty or reliability.</p> <p>Bitcoin was the first blockchain to introduce basic smart contracts, where transactions are only validated if specific conditions are met.

The information is open to everyone involved, ensuring clarity and preventing misunderstandings.</p> </li> <li> <p>Self-Governance: Smart contracts eliminate the need for intermediaries, such as brokers or lawyers, to validate the agreement.

Consensus ensures that all nodes agree on the state of the blockchain, including account balances, transactions, and more.</p> <p>Proof of Work (PoW) PoW relies on nodes solving cryptographic puzzles to validate transactions and create new blocks.

Instead of miners, PoS relies on validators who lock a portion of their cryptocurrency as a stake. Validators are chosen to propose the next block based on their stake and uptime.

The validators receive rewards proportional to their bets.</p> <p>XinFin Delegated Proof of Stake (XDPoS) XDPoS is an evolution of PoS and offers greater efficiency. It uses a reputation-based system to achieve consensus, where master nodes create blocks in a round-robin manner.
