title: XDC Network - Devnet RPC
---

# Devnet RPC
The XDC Devnet is a specialized test environment for the XDC Network, designed to closely mirror the Mainnet's functionality. The Devnet provides developers with a safe, controlled setting to test, deploy, and refine their applications using test tokens instead of real assets. This environment is crucial for ensuring that applications are robust and secure before they go live on the Mainnet.

**Public Networks**
Similar to the Mainnet, users can access the XDC Devnet via an internet connection and a full node RPC. The Devnet allows developers to perform the same operations they would on the Mainnet, including reading blockchain data, creating and validating transactions, and deploying smart contracts. However, since the Devnet operates with test tokens, developers can experiment freely without the financial risks associated with live transactions.
