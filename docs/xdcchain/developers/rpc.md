# Network Endpoints

The XDC Network is a robust, enterprise-grade blockchain platform designed for decentralized finance (DeFi), global trade, and other high-demand applications. For developers and users interacting with the XDC Network, the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) interface is a critical component. This guide provides a detailed overview of the RPC endpoints for both the XDC Mainnet and the Apothem Testnet, including their specifications and usage.

## What is RPC?
Remote Procedure Call (RPC) is a protocol that allows communication between a client and a server over a network. In the context of blockchain, RPC is used to interact with the blockchain network by sending requests to full nodes. These requests can include reading blockchain data, creating and broadcasting transactions, and deploying smart contracts.
