# XDCScan Testnet (Apothem)

## Overview:
The [Apothem XDCScan](https://apothem.xdcscan.io/) is the XDC Network’s official test environment. XDCScan Testnet (Apothem) is the block explorer for this testnet, offering all the features of XDCScan but in a testnet context. It is ideal for developers who want to simulate the mainnet environment as closely as possible before deploying their projects.

## Key Features:

- **Testnet Environment:** A near-exact replica of the XDC mainnet, but with test XDC (TXDC) for development purposes.
- **Comprehensive Testing:** Developers can simulate real-world scenarios and network conditions to ensure their smart contracts and dApps function as expected.
- **Community Testing:** A platform for community-driven testing of new features and updates before they are rolled out to the mainnet.

## Use Cases:

- **Pre-Mainnet Testing:** Ensure smart contracts and applications are fully functional and secure before mainnet deployment.
- **Education and Training:** A learning environment for new developers to practice and improve their skills on the XDC Network.
